                        <p>Hello! I'm Steven Huynh, a recent graduate from University of California, Irvine with a Bachelors in Game Design and Interactive Media. Ever since I was a child, I was captivated by games and as I grew older, I realized that being part of the game development scene was something I wanted to be a part of. Being innovative and working towards a goal is something that I have always wanted to do. In fact, not to break the fourth wall (I just did though...), this website was actually made using html, css, js, and GitHub which shows my design capabilities.</p>

            <h2>My Work</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll find a selection of my recent projects, showcasing my skills in design and multimedia. Each project includes a carousel of images to give you a closer look at my work. I am more of a designer rather than a programmer however, I do know a bit of Python, JavaScript, R, SQL, and C#.</p>

                                <p>This project was a student capstone project for my senior year. It is a medieval fantasy twist on the card game Spades but made in Unity 3D, which involves the audience to play against Death. This was a team of 8 students and took about 6 months to do from October 2023 to March 2024.</p>
